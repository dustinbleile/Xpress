### Random Point notes

 1. Expression can be complicated:
     * Cite GSC UoA - decrease mRNA resulting more expression - Overall ratios of all transcripts.
 1. Toxic Expression Levels - mutually exclusive genes - overactive pathway.
 1. Pathway level expressions and categories?
 
 Other effects
 1. Low expression levels are irrelvant for very active proteins.
     * Activating mutations.
     * Activating fusions
     * Can pathway activation / deactivation be used to identify?
 1. Micro-environment effects - cell vs tumour micro env
 1. PDL1 vs mutation burden - patterns for tumour immune attack.
